How to use PeLock 1.06 (regged) ImpRec plugin:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  If you want to use this plugin to fix all missing imports you must create file
name  dll.txt  in  the  same folder as .exe you are fixing. Content of this .txt
file is name (or Full path) of .dll file whose imports you are currently fixing.
So  if  missing  import  is  in kernel32.dll you will enter kernel32.dll in .txt
file,  save  it  and  run plugin via ImpRec. If you need more then one .dll file
edit .txt file for each .dll file. Example dll.txt is included in this package.
