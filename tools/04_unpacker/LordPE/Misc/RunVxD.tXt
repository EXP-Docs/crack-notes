RunVxD 1.0
----------
coded by yoda (28 June 2k+1)

This is a little tool to load/unload VxD's and pass control codes to them.
With this utility you won't have to code always a stupid loader for each VxD.

Command line:
 RunVxD [OPTIONS]
 Options:
 /LOAD="vxd name"    - load VxD (filename with file extension)
 /UNLOAD             - unload currently loaded VxD
 /WAIT_UNLOAD        - unload currently loaded VxD after input
 /DEVICEIO=X         - pass control code X (in hex) to the driver

HaVe PhUn !
