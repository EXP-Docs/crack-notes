	- Fixed Vista64 crash bug (jstorme)
	- GUI modified and improved (based upon Fly's modification)
	- Updated/corrected plugins and deleted dups


v1.6 FINAL (PUBLIC VERSION)
---------------------------

- Misc

	- Finally fixed the bug in the check for adding section (Thanks to Christoph)


v1.6 beta *PRIVATE*

----------------------
- Tracers
	- Tracer Level3
		- New approach (Thanks to EliCZ)
			- Support SEH chain
			- No more FS instructions emulation

	- Tested under NT4 (Thanks to Unknown One)
	- The Import Editor (double click on a function) will look for the nearest valid
	  function in the thunk and will get its module name. => Much faster when editing
	  each function by hand.
	- Improved 'Exact Call' (It will not retrace all exact calls from a slot if they
	  have already been resolved)
	- New Module Loader (It should be faster)
	- Support function names which have more than 256 characters. ImportREC left when
	  clicking on <Get Imports> (Thanks to ToyBomB and shandi for reports)
	- <Save Log> added (Right click on the Log listbox)
	- Fixed Import Editor to look for the name first before looking for the ordinal

	  even when you have selected several slots to trace
	- ApiHooks Updated (Greetings to EliCZ)

	  reloc'ed target for example (Thanks to Thigo)

- Correct ImageSize in PE Header when adding a new section (Windows 98SE and 2k do it
  automatically but it is better to do it ourselves though)

v1.2b2
------
- Argh!!!! Export ordinals were fixed now! Sorry, i have forgotten to add the Base for all

  portable to another system)
- Fixed a GPF (oops! :-P) when invalidate some particular APIs
- Load and Save Tree Models
- Enable and Disable controls (buttons and editboxes) when necessary
- Tracer level2 is slower (not under Win2000! ;-)) but less buggy than previous version

  ImportREC will be able to rebuild a 100% portable executable (or very close) with it.
