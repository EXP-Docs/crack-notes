 How to use it:   -> ImpRec plugin for PrivateExeProtector 1.8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Please  not  that this plugin is made for my use only! This means that it will
calculate  the  APIs  for  .exe  file fixed in special maner. You must wipe from
header  the  section  before  the last and fix the last section by reverting two
first numbers of last section`s virtual address to 0x00. After this you must fix
all addresses that lead to the last section. Then you can use this plugin!

 List of stolen APIs fixed:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 GetModuleHandleA
 ExitProcess
 GetModuleFileNameA
