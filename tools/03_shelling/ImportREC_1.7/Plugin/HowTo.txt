 Ok I re-coded TPP plugin to support fully stolen APIs. If you want to use this option you must create file name dll.txt in the same folder as .exe you are fixing. Content of this .txt file is name (or Full path) of .dll file whose imports you are fixing. So if missing import is in kernel32.dll you will enter kernel32.dll in .txt file, save it and run plugin via ImpRec. If you need more then one .dll file edit .txt file for each .dll file.
