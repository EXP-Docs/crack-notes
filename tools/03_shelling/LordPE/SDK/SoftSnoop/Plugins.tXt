SoftSnoop's Plugin Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SoftSnoop (SS) has a plugin interface from version 1.2 on.
It's realized though dlls.
In the SS path has to be a subdirectory with the
name: "Plugins". All dlls in this directory are loaded
on the startup of SS. A log-file will be created in the
"Plugins" directory to make problems while plugin development
easier to find.
To get the API addresses of SS you've to call "GetSSApi" which
SoftSnoop.exe exports. 
Example:
---------------------------------------------------------------
case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
	// get "GetSSApi" address of SoftSnoop
	hSS = GetModuleHandle(NULL);
	if (!hSS)
		return FALSE;
	GetSSApi = (fGetSSApi)GetProcAddress(hSS, "GetSSApi");
	if (!GetSSApi)
		return FALSE;
	// call the function (get struct pointer)
	pSSApi = GetSSApi();
	break;
---------------------------------------------------------------

..."GetSSApi" will return a pointer to a structure with all API
addresses and information SS provides for the plugins.

There are 2 ways to make your plugin name appear in the SS's
plugin menu:

1.)
The dll exports a funtion named "StartSSPlugin". The dll's name
without extension will be show in the plugin menu. If the user
clicks on this menu item then the exported funtion will be called.

2.)
You can also use the "AddPluginFunction" API of SS to add a plugin
function in SS's menu.

For closer information look at the plugin examples and at
SSPlugin.h !

Please send me your plugins ;)
