Why LordPE ???:
---------------
"PEditor" is dead since some time :((( It wasn't updated anymore.
It's coded in a very bad way. M.o.D. and I were very young coders
as we started to develope it ;) That's one reason for me not to add
code to PEditor anymore.
As it seems that some people are using it, I tried to recode all the
stuff. It's name is "LordPE". I decided to code this project in C
because a big part of it is GUI shit.
LordPE is not finished up to now...
I hope some people will like it ;)

General notes:
--------------
- Break&Enter:
   - Sometimes you have to scroll up a bit to see the original
     byte in your debugger.
   - If you want to dump a dll then assemble e.g. a "jmp eip"
     in it and click in LordPE's main window on the process
     "TrapDll.exe". In its module list you'll find the target
     dll which you can dump.

- Task viewer:
   - "Correct ImageSize" kills the dump protection, based on
     modifing the ImageSize value of the internal windows variables,
     by ANAKiN. This technic is e.g. used in PEShield
   - It's possible to dump only sections from process modules in
     memory by loading the file into the PE editor (via temporary file!)
     and then you can save any section inside the section table viewer
     as usual to disk          

- PE editor:
   - If LordPE couldn't get write access to the target file then the
     file is opened in read only mode. In this case all "save"-
     buttons and so on are disabled.
   - you can resize splitted sections before unsplitting
   - To be able to use the TDSC, you need to be installed Internet
     Explorer 4 or higher !   
   - With the "+" beside the SizeOfHeaders edit box one can make the
     PE header grow in 0x200 bytes steps. This could be useful e.g. if
     a packer/compressor reports about not enough room in the section
     table or in the PE header.
   - the "..." buttons show more information about the target item
   - the "L" buttons do lunch the Structure Lister on the target item
   - the "H" buttons do lunch 16Edit.dll - hex edit the target item
   - Keep attention, while modifing the number of DataDirectories! On
     windows 9x and NT based OSs disappeares the file icon sometimes
     if there were less than 16 DataDirectories registered in the PE header.
     Additionally on 9x OSs (I tested WinME only) you shouldn't wipe
     the 10th DataDirectory (TLS Table Directory). It would make
     the Win32 loader crash.


LordPE.exe command line:
------------------------
/NOTRADEMARK
Avoids LordPE from pasting a trademark into PE files. This is usually 
done after the following things:
 - full module dump
 - rebuilding
 - add imports
 - doing a full dump with the Dumper Server

/BREAKENTER"%path%"
Break&Enter at the specified file. The main dialog won't be shown.
%path% - path to a dll or exe file whose EntryPoint should be trapped

/PEEDIT"%path%"
Opens up the PE editor. The main dialog won't be shown.
%path% - path to file to edit with PE editor

/LDS%modifiers%
Lunches the DumperServer. The main dialog won't be shown.
%modifiers% - could be "+L" / "-L" (enable/disable request logging) and/or
              "+T" / "-T" (enable/disable topmost)
