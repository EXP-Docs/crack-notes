[Paths]
# you have to set the path for mingw g++ correctly
# bin and include paths are supposed to be in /bin and /include subdirs respectivly
# you can specify the paths either directly (ex: C:\mingw4.4.1 or by using variables
# used by radasm :
#	($A stands for assembler path).
#	($R stands for radasm path).
# you can let bin and includes unchanged.
$A=$R\MinGW
$B=$A\Bin
$I=$A\Include
